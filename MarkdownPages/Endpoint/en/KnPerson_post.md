# KnPerson

Create or modify a person. Available as a standalone UpdateConnector, but also as a sub-object in, among others, KnEmployee. The functionality is nearly identical in both situations.

None of the sub-objects of this UpdateConnector support supplying multiple lines. So, for example, to add multiple bank accounts, multiple calls will need to be made.
