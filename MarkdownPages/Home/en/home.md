AFAS Software provides software for various organizations and industries. AFAS offers two main products: Profit and SB.

## Profit

Profit is an ERP solution for all your business processes. The integration of processes plays an important role here. With Profit, you automate everything (well, as much as possible) and you record data only once. Profit is a standard solution with a back-office application, intranet, extranet, and an app. The solution is flexible and provides a solution for many different organizations. To connect with external systems, you use connectors.

## SB

AFAS SB is designed for entrepreneurs, startups, and grow-ups. In SB, the entrepreneur and the accountant work together, and maintaining your company accounts is a matter of minutes. SB provides insight and convenience.
