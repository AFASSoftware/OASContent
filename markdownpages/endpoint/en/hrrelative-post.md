Through this endpoint, you create a dossier item (type Family member mutation (Profit) / -41) with a workflow for an employee's manager in InSite. The family member becomes available to the employee when it is approved. The approval can be done through a manual action by the manager, an automatic action in the workflow, or by using the UpdateConnector [`/connectors/KnSubjectWorkflowReaction`](../../api-specs/en/Dossiers%2C%20bijlagen%20en%20workflows#post-/connectors/KnSubjectWorkflowReaction)
