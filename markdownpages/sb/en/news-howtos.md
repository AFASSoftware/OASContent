Welcome to a brand new version of the AFAS API Docs. In this new version we are glad to share our new **How-To** guides. These guides share our process knowledge to help you make the process of integrating with AFAS SB as smooth as possible. Ever since we starting creating the API Docs pages we wanted to share these step-by-step guides to make integrations work the first time around and not through an iterative process.

To use the How-To's a great option is to start with the [relations](./howto%20relations).

## Misc changes

Other changes are:

- Timestamps in articles so you can see when we last modified the content
- Better scaling for smaller devices
- *News* category to share important changes
