## AFAS Connect

Use interactive tooling for the AFAS Profit REST and SOAP API via [connect.afas.nl](https://connect.afas.nl/)

To use this tooling, you need an environment and API token. Once you have them, you can directly connect to the environment and see the permissions you have with your token. This enables you to see, test and explore the custom fields and endpoints that are available.

## Postman

Use the AFAS API OpenAPI Specifications directly with Postman. You can [import these specifications into Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/integrations/available-integrations/working-with-openAPI/). The OpenAPI Specifications can be downloaded at the top of each API Specification. For example, at [Dossier](../../api-specs/en/Organisaties%20en%20personen). Copy this content as described in the Postman documentation.

## RSS feed AFAS Status

[AFASStatus.nl](https://afasstatus.nl/) provides an overview of maintenance and disruptions on the AFAS Online platform. You can read this via the RSS feed at `https://info.afasstatus.nl/afasstatus.rss`
