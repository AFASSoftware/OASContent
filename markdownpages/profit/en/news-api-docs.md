Welcome to the latest version of the AFAS API Docs. We are happy that you are using it! With the AFAS API Docs, we want to make it as easy as possible to create great integrations with AFAS products. For this, we have made an extensive API specification with more than 1000 example requests. What are you most happy with? We are very satisfied with all the examples at [KnEmployee](../../api-specs/en/Employee%20and%20contract#post-/connectors/KnEmployee).

## How-To's

New in this version are the How-To's. These give you step-by-step instructions on How-To make integrations with AFAS in various areas. Here you can read years of experience from our consultants and developers that you can directly use in your integration.

## Overview of all endpoints

There is also [one overview](https://help.afas.nl/profit/spec/en/allendpoints) made with all endpoints in the AFAS Profit API. This is ideal if you want to see all standard connectors.

## Better integration with AFAS Connect

From UpdateConnectors in AFAS Connect, you now get a direct link to the documentation in the AFAS API Docs.

## Profit 36 changes

All API changes that become active per Profit 6 are described in the [changelog](./news-profit6). Here you can see all changes in the API schemas.

## XML-Token naar Authorization header converter

New users sometimes struggle with creating the correct header for REST request. Therefore we have created a simple XML to Base64 converter that generates the header value for you: [XML token to Base64](../../../tools#base64-encoder)

## Mobile ready

Sizing was still an issue in the first version. Significant steps have been made in that area. A dark mode would also be nice as a next step, right? We want to include that in a future update.

## Last updated in documentation

In the documentation and in the How-To's you can now also see when it was last updated.
